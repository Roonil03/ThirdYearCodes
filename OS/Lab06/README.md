# Lab Exercise

1. Develop a menu driven C program to implement the following process scheduling algorithms:
   - Preemptive SJF
   - Round Robin (RR)
   - Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling algorithms

# Additional Exercises

1. Write C program to implement FCFS (Assuming all the processes arrive at the same time)

2. Write a C program to implement non-preemptive SJF, where the arrival time is different for the processes.
