# Lab exercise:

1. Write a C program to simulate page replacement algorithms: FIFO and optimal. Frame allocation has to be done as per user input and use dynamic allocation for all data structures.

2. Write a C program to simulate LRU Page Replacement. Frame allocation has to be done as per user input and dynamic allocation for all data structures.
